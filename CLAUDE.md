# Project context

## What this is

A site that gives a hands-on introduction to product analytics work, taking a
beginner through to senior-level technical ability.

## Stack

Astro (static output, no server adapter), TypeScript, Vitest, ESLint.
Hosting: Vercel, zero-configuration static detection. See ADR 0001
(`docs/decisions/0001-framework-choice.md`) for why.

## Commands

- Install: `npm ci`
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Checks CI runs: `npm run typecheck` (`astro check`), `npm run lint`
  (`eslint .`), `npm run test` (`vitest run`), `npm run build`
  (`astro build`).

The checks above are what CI runs. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls the
factory's reusable Node path with the defaults (`checks:
'typecheck,lint,test,build'`), so the required check reports as
`ci / typecheck, lint, test, build`.

Whatever the gate runs, the rule is the same. If a check is renamed here,
rename it in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the same commit, and re-point the
branch protection rule in the same sitting, or the gate silently stops checking
that thing.

**Publishing gap.** Closed - see ADR 0001. Vercel auto-detects Astro and runs
`npm run build` (`astro build`) with no adapter for this static site, so the
local build command and Vercel's are the same program. No divergence to
document.

## How work moves

Objectives become issues labelled `objective`. A human labels the objective
`agent:queued`; nothing else needs labelling by hand. The orchestrator splits it
into 2-5 child issues, each with acceptance criteria and one role label, and
then queues them itself as each one becomes ready.

It stays with the objective after the split. A child reaching `agent:review` or
`agent:blocked` wakes it: it reads the state of every child, queues whatever the
merge has just unblocked, rewrites and re-queues a child that blocked on its own
scoping, and replaces the status picture on the parent issue. The parent issue
is the whole surface - a human reads that and nothing else, and hears from the
orchestrator when a decision is genuinely theirs.

Ready means the issues a child depends on are merged to the default branch, not
merely finished and labelled `agent:review`. An agent reads the default branch,
so work that is finished but unmerged is invisible to the child that depends on
it. Which roles open a pull request for their own work is not restated here -
each role file says what that role does, and a summary of it in this file could
only drift. A run started too early refuses, correctly, and still spends one of
that issue's three attempts. That check is now the orchestrator's to make before
it queues anything.

The human still decides what merges. The orchestrator queues work and reports on
it; it does not merge a pull request, and it cannot break a child down further -
that comes back as `needs-decomposition` and a comment on the parent.

A role that hits a decision it cannot make asks it on its own issue and keeps
working under the answer it recommends. That question comes back labelled
`agent:needs-input`, which rides alongside `agent:review` rather than replacing
it: the work shipped and is reviewable, and what is waiting is an answer, not a
run. The orchestrator carries it onto the parent issue verbatim, so the parent
stays the only page a human has to read. It blocks the merge and nothing else,
and no merge policy covers it - that one is always the person's.

Labels: `objective`, `agent:queued`, `agent:running`, `agent:review`,
`agent:blocked`, `agent:needs-input`, `needs-decomposition`, `needs-human`,
`role:researcher`, `role:analyst`, `role:designer`, `role:engineer`.

## Driving an objective

A session that files an objective, or is pointed at one, is that objective's
driver and the person's window into it. Nobody else is watching. Filing one is
`/objective`, which refines the idea, sets the merge policy, queues it, and
hands back to the session to drive.

**Shorthand:** a message starting with `obj` - any case, with or without a
trailing `.` or `:` - means the same thing as typing `/objective`. Read
`.claude/commands/objective.md` and follow it, treating the rest of the
message as the rough idea. Nothing else is shorthand for anything; a plain
description of work with no `obj` prefix is a question or a discussion, not an
instruction to file something.

**Waking back up is `/check-in`.** Whether that is a person resuming a
session, a scheduled wake, or a subscribed pull request's activity firing one,
it runs the same catch-up: what is waiting on the person first, then the state
of every child, merging under the policy where it applies.

**Read `.claude/skills/driving-an-objective/` whenever an objective is in play**
- what to do with its merge policy, how to report, how to put a blocker so it
can be answered, and what only the person can decide. This paragraph exists to
say the role is yours; the skill says how to hold it.

## The rules

Not restated here. Two sections used to summarise them and every line had a
fuller source a click away, so the summaries could only ever drift out of
agreement with the thing they summarised - which is worse than not having them,
because a reader who finds a rule here stops looking for the real one.

- `.claude/skills/house-rules/` - what must be true before work starts and
  before anything merges, who may merge, the three-strike rule, and what no
  agent may touch.
- `.claude/skills/memory-protocol/` - how this repository's lessons are stored,
  capped, proposed, and retired.
- `.claude/skills/acceptance-criteria/` - what a criterion has to look like to
  gate anything.
- `.claude/skills/driving-an-objective/` - what the session in front of a person
  does once an objective is running.

Every agent run is told to follow the first three by name. The fourth is for the
session driving, which is why the section above names it rather than leaving it
to be discovered.
